Arrays
    - Fixed in size
    - Fast for data retrivals
    - Compact memory usage if size is known
    - Delete operation very hard
    - 2D Arrays

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List Interface :
    - An ordered collection aka sequence.
    - Allow duplicates
    - Not Fixed in size like arrays
    - Fast for dat retrivals
    - Various implementations
        - ArrayList
        - Stack
        - Vector
        - Others

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.
It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack.
The usual push and pop operations are provided
as well as a method peek at the top item on the stack
a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method
to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization: Vector is synchronized, which means only one thread at a time can access the code,
while ArrayList is not synchronized, which means multiple threads can work on ArrayList at the same time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Queue
FiFO (First In First Out)
A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sets:
A collection that contains no duplicate elements.
More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equal(e2),
and at most one null element.

As implied by its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Map :
    - A map cannot contain duplicated keys.
    - Each key can map to at most one value.
